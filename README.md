# AddressBook
Project for COMP 365 [![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/cadeo111/addressbook/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/cadeo111/addressbook)




### To Debug
- AddRecord.java  (needs to handle setting record values)
- DeleteRecord.java (user isn't authorized for this command)
- DisplayAuditLog.java (admin isn't authorized for this command)
- EditRecord.java (shouldn't rely on parseArg() from AddRecord.java)
- GetRecord.java (Now causes a Ãœser Databse Failed to Write!" after two ADR commands)


### Bug-Free
- Login.java
- Logout.java
- Help.java
- Exit.java
- Command.java
- CommandException.java
- AddUser.java
- ChangePassword.java
- DeleteUser.java
- ImportDatabase.java

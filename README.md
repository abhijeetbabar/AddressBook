# AddressBook
Project for COMP 365 [![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/cadeo111/addressbook/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/cadeo111/addressbook)




### To Debug
- DisplayAuditLog.java (The command is not implemented... just writes 'TEST LOG')
- GetRecord.java (Now causes a "User Database Failed to Write!" after two ADR commands)
- AddressDatabase.java (I think the merge went bad... Now has a number of compiler errors, including no decrypt lambda)
